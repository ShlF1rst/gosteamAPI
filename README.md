# GoSteamAPI

Golang module for fast and easy access to steam data.

## Goal

I would like to create comprehensive client for all steam web-api calls, that
can be used as a baseline for other golang steam based applications. 

*It is my pet project to improve in golang on my free time. 
It might take quite a long to cover all models and calls, but feel
free to suggest some features.*
